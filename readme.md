# AniMadeus-py

New version of the [aniMadeus](https://github.com/WarwickAnimeSoc/aniMadeus) bot for the University of Warwick Anime and Manga Society discord server.

## Running the Project

To run the site locally for development, you should set up a virtual environment running Python 3.8.5 and install all
the necessary dependencies from `requirements.txt` .

This repository contains all the files needed to run the bot, except for the config file, which future webmasters will
need to copy to their machine from the server.

## Todo

- Add website API commands (!events and !library)
